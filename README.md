# Corvid Toes v1

v1 is the test of a fairly dumb person trying to learn to make engines

## Compilation
use (powershell)
```powershell
gcc corvid_toes.c src/board.c src/move_gen.c src/eval.c src/search.c -Iincludes -o corvid_toes ; ./corvid_toes.exe
```
in order to compile and run it

## Capabilities

As of when I'm writing this, it's still uncapable of playing a game.
